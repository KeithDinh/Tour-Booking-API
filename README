********************* APP NOTES *********************

"*": definition

*(req,res): route handler
*req.params: route parameters (after the / with colon : in the URL) /:id
*req.query: the URL query parameters (after the ? in the URL)

To detect if a function is asynchronous, use the function's constructor.name property:
console.log(myFunction.constructor.name === "AsyncFunction");

*mergeParams: Preserve the req.params values from the parent router. If the parent and the child have conflicting param names, the childâ€™s value take precedence.

********************* TOKEN NOTES *********************

JWT properties: iat-issued at | exp - expiration


********** FORGOT PASSWORD NOTES **********
Save the hashed token to db, but send the actual token to user's email
    Explanation: 
    1st method: real token in db and hashed token to users 
        => hackers can access db and hash the real token to get actual token
    2nd method: hashed token in db and actual token to users 
        => hackers can access db but CANNOT revert the hashed token to get actual token
    => 2nd is safer 

********************* MONGOOSE NOTES *********************

mongoose: an object modeling library that gives a higher level of abtraction over the regular mongodb driver
ndb: debugger for node js
*isModified is a built-in function

*.findIdAndUpdate: Mongoose doesn't keep the current value to compare with the new value. It doesn't re-validate data by the model validations or pre-processing by the hooks to hash password. Only use when the data is NOT password

"post" hook does not have "next" like "pre" hook

// using regex, schema.pre(/^findOneAnd/) is called when any findOneAnd function is called (NOTE: findIdAndUpdate, findIdAndDelete are shorthands of findOneAnd with id)

********************* EMAIL NOTES *********************

Mailtrap: a development service that fakes to send emails to real addresses
These emails end up trapped in a development inbox


********************* POSTMAN NOTES *********************

Postman allows users to create environments (Ex: development, prod, etc.)
Variables in Postman are called in between two curly brackets {{ }}

In test, pm.environment.set("jwt", pm.response.json().token) set the variable in the environment
